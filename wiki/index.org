An informal wiki of sorts.

* Digital Garden

#+begin_quote
At times, wilderness is exactly what readers want: a rich collection of
resources and links. At times, rigid formality suits readers perfectly,
providing precisely the information they want, no more and no less.
Indeed, individual hypertexts and Web sites may contain sections that
tend toward each extreme.

Often, however, designers should strive for the comfort, interest, and
habitability of parks and gardens: places that invite visitors to
remain, and that are designed to engage and delight them, to invite them
to linger, to explore, and to reflect.

* Git

I want to get rid of all local modifications and go back to the working
tree of the most recent commit:

#+begin_src sh
git restore .
#+end_src

Revert a specified commit:

#+begin_src sh
git revert commit-id
#+end_src

Reset the repository to a specific commit in the git log:

#+begin_src sh
git reset --mixed commit-id
#+end_src

I need to commit and push changes to a remote that has been changed
since my most recent pull:

#+begin_src sh
git pull --rebase
#+end_src

* Software

** Laptop

Alpine 3.18.2; no DE.

I currently run my Alpine laptop via the default login shell - no
desktop environment. From here, I use a mix of byobu and emacs to split
my screen into tabs and panes. All programs run through the shell and do
not use visual libraries such as X or Wayland.

I have Sway installed and configured, but only launch it when I must.

- brightnessctl
- byobu
- emacs
- [font-dejavu, font-noto, font-noto-cjk, font-noto-cjk-extra]
- glances
- gnupg
- irssi
- lynx
- nano
- neomutt
- newsboat
- ohmyzsh
- [pango, pango-tools]
- pipewire
- syncthing
- wireguard
- zola
- zsh

** Server

Ubuntu 22.04.1; no DE.

See my services page for a list of the publicly-available services
running on this server.

- certbot
- [docker, docker-compose]
- nginx
- zsh
