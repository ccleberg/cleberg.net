#+title: README

* Overview

This project uses [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] to structure all documents, including the index page
and sub-pages such as blog posts.

* Configuration

If you want to replicate this project structure, you'll need to customize your
=.emacs= file appropriately.

My =.emacs= file below show a handful of project-related settings

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp

(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(("cleberg.net"
	 :base-directory "~/Source/cleberg.net/"

#+END_SRC

If you're within emacs while changing =.emacs=, you'll need to reload the
configuration with =M-x load-file= and hit enter to reload the current file
(=.emacs=).

* Building

When ready to publish, open any of the =.org= files in the project and execute
=M-x org-publish-current-project=.

If you want to force emacs to re-publish all files, including files without
changes, execute =C-u M-x org-publish-current-project=.
