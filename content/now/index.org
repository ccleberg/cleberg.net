This is a [[https://nownownow.com/about][/now]] page.

* Work

- Closed out year-end work and will be pushing hard to get 12/31 clients closed
  out in the next month or two.
- Making moves with leadership on some national initiatives that I will be
  spearheading.

* Media

/I play and watch *way* too many games, shows, and movies to list them all here.
If you're actually interested, email or message me to talk about media!/

- Playing some games:
  - Cyberpunk 2077
  - Runescape 3
- Watching some shows:
  - Danganronpa
  - Jujutsu Kaisen
  - Wild Boyz
- Watched some movies:
  - Trees Lounge (1996)
  - Lost in Translation (2003)
  - The Break-Up (2006)
  - Fruitvale Station (2013)
  - The Florida Project (2017)
  - Requiem for a Dream (2000)
  - Cadillac Records (2008)
  - Synecdoche, New York (2008)
  - Anomalisa (2015)
  - Blue Valentine (2010)

* Tech

- Reducing tech usage as much as possible:
  - I've deleted even more online accounts and am down to under 90 at this point
    (started between 150-300).
  - I've reset my devices and installed minimal profiles for specific use cases
    and not to browse.
  - I'm tracking device usage more intentionally and am only using them to
    accomplish a purpose. Otherwise, I'm diverting my attention to non-tech
    activities.
  - Next step is to introduce more physical media back into my life. E.g.,
    notebooks, books to read, lists on the fridge, etc.

* Hobbies

- Built another bookshelf with wood from my garage in an afternoon. Stained it
  but not a huge fan of the color; might paint it instead. It's cheap wood, so
  nothing that would be a shame to paint over.
- Deployed [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)#Onion_services][onion service]] mirrors of my website and subdomains. Also advertised
  their Onion Locations via HTTP headers, so users are automatically notified
  that I have an onion version available when using Tor.
