This is a [[https://nownownow.com/about][/now]] page.

* Work

- Recently appointed as the DevOps SMP and the GitLab SMP (Subject Matter
  Practitioner) at [[https://kpmg.com/us/en.html][KPMG]]. Add that to my list of already being the Automation
  Champion and one of the AI Champions for the North Central business unit.
- Getting ready for my FY25 engagements at work, with a few new clients this
  year.
- Finished a PCAOB inspection on one of the new clients I join mid-year in 2024.

* Media

- Playing a few games:
  - Black Ops 6
  - Dynasty Warriors: Origins
  - Nier: Automata
  - Rocket League
  - Stellar Blade
- Watching some shows:
  - Bad Monkey
  - Ramen Akaneko
  - Sakamoto Days
  - Wilfred

* Tech

- Working through some GitLab certifications.
- Achieved my GitHub Foundations cert. Very easy.
- Migrated source code back to [[https://github.com/ccleberg][GitHub]].
- Migrated domain back to [[https://cleberg.net][cleberg.net]] from =cmc.pub=.
- Deleted a bunch of accounts to reduce online footprint. Looking for more ways
  to reduce.

* Hobbies

- Still looking for ideas in the tech area as I've been fairly tapped out this
  last year. Feels like most of my innovation happens at work, which I can't
  share online.
- Weather has been warming up, so disc golf frequency is increasing.
- Meeting new people at the pub nearby.
