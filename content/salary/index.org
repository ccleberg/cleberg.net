** Salary Transparency
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: salary-transparency
:END:
The data below details the base salary information for each job I've held. This
information is posted publicly to ensure others in my position have a solid
reference point when determining if their current or proposed salary is
appropriate.

While sites like Glassdoor are locking salary data behind a paywall, LinkedIn is
discontinuing LinkedIn Salary, and helpful websites like [[https://www.big4transparency.com/][Big 4 Transparency]] are
extremely rare, I wanted to provide my personal data publicly and freely to
those who need it.

I have seen what can happen when great employees don't know the market values
for their skills and I happily help those in my teams, so I'm happy to extend
this information to the online community.

As a final note, there are numerous reasons that people in the same role are
paid differently (expertise, years of experience, certifications, education,
etc.) and that the data in this table should only be used as a single point of
reference, not the whole story.

Note: When in a role that gives periodic raises, I will create a new record with
the new base salary in the table below. See the KPMG records for an example of a
raise while in the same role.

This table is a compressed version of the data, so that it can fit reliably on
screens. For the full dataset with all fields, open the =source data= link below
the table.

This page was inspired by [[https://xeiaso.net/salary-transparency/][Xe]], and I'm quoting the following wording from them as
I want to reiterate this piece:

#+begin_quote
Please consider publishing your salary data like this as well. By open,
voluntary transparency we can help to end stigmas around discussing pay and help
ensure that the next generations of people in tech are treated fairly. Stigmas
thrive in darkness but die in the light of day. You can help end the stigma by
playing your cards out in the open like this.
