#+title: Uses
#+slug: index

What are the technologies behind ~cleberg.net~? See below. I tend to flip-flop on
my DNS providers and Git hosts often, but the rest of these technologies are
consistently powering this website.

I've also included various technologies that I use /while/ building ~cleberg.net~,
as they seem relevant to complete the picture.

* Philosophy

My choice of tools is guided by a few core "soft" requirements that are more
important to me than convenience or feature-creep:

- Digital Sovereignty: If I don't own the hardware or the plain-text source, I
  don't truly own the content. This site lives in my rack, not on someone else's
  "cloud."
- Zero Tracking: I have no interest in your data. I don't use cookies, I don't
  track your IP, and I don't care how many "unique visitors" I have. If the
  content is useful, it will find its way via RSS or word-of-mouth.
- Disposable Infrastructure: The server is a pet, but the site is a cattle.
  Because the entire build is driven by org-mode and a single ~build.py~ script, I
  can lose the entire machine and be back online on a fresh OS in minutes.
- Minimalist Stack: I prefer tools that do one thing well. Weblorg for static
  generation and Nginx for serving files is a stack that will likely still work
  ten years from now without a single dependency update.

[fn:1] I hate myself a little bit for using Cloudflare, but they've proven to be
extremely reliable over the years and have not invaded my privacy (at least, in
a visible manner). They also allow me to experience a large jump in security for
zero cost, which is nice.
[fn:2] I don't get paid for this, so I only test my site in my current primary
browser(s).
[fn:3] I have nothing to back up except the source code (which is already
"backed up" via Git), since I do not collect or store any user data.

* Hardware

I run most of my services from my custom, rack-mounted server (details below),
but I also run a Dell Optiplex and a Raspbery Pi 4 for some miscellaneous
services.

See the following blog post for more information on this server: [[https://cleberg.net/blog/server-build.html][Building a
High-Performance Rack-Mounted Server with Consumer PC Components]].

[fn:4] Specifically chosen for onboard graphics support to avoid needing a
dedicated GPU in the rack.
