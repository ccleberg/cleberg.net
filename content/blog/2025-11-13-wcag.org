* WCAG 2

What are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 requirements?

While the full list of WCAG requirements may seem intimidating, it's actually
straightforward for a static site like =cleberg.net= if you are intentional
about design. Luckily, they offer a [[https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/][Quick Reference]] guide that is much easier to
parse than the full specification.

So, while it wasn't onerous to push myself over the 100% threshold, I wanted to
write about how my current website design contributed to my compliance rate and
why WCAG is important.

* Why WCAG?

Before I dive into the specifics of how my website complies with these
requirements, I wanted to touch on the importance of WCAG itself.

There are three major reasons I wanted to implement the WCAG requirements on my
website:

1. *Usability*: The main reason, which I've covered in numerous other blog posts
   about minimalism and design, is usability. I believe that our tech should
   always serve a purpose and I believe that the design of a tool should
   encapsulate that idea. Therefore, designing a website with intent leads to
   better usability, both by those with and without disabilities.
2. *Kindness*: What's better than designing a tool accessible by /everyone/?
   Personally, I love the idea that no matter who visits my website, they should
   experience the same content and same utility intended by the website.
3. *Future-Proofing*: Technology, include internet tools, are changing
   constantly. When a website is well-designed, reachable by all audiences, and
   utilitarian, it will be able to last longer or even "decay gracefully".

* Implementing WCAG On My Website

Since I do not implement JavaScript, forms, or multimedia content on my website,
the list of items to implement was short.

I'll go through some of the items that I considered during my manual
verification of the site. If an item is not on this list, it is either *not
applicable* or the native browser functionality covers the requirement and I do
not implement any custom element that would require verification.

- [1.1]: Text alternatives for non-text content (i.e., images)
        - For each image within my website, I made sure that alt-text was
          available.
- [1.3.1]: Use Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) landmarks to
  identify regions of a page
        - ARIA landmarks are available for the navigation menu on my website,
          which is the only element I use which is recommended by WCAG to have
          an ARIA role.
- [1.3.1]: Use semantic HTML elements to identify regions of a page
        - I have always used semantic HTML, but I reviewed my HTML templates to
          ensure I had coverage. In short, I use elements like =<nav>=,
          =<main>=, =<article>=, and =<footer>= instead of =<div>= elements.
- [1.4.1]: Use a color with a relative luminance difference of 3:1 or greater
        - When choosing the color palettes for this site, I ensured that all
          were at least AA compliant and in most cases, AAA compliant.
- [1.4.4]: Use em (or rem) units for font sizes
        - All sizing on this site uses =rem= sizing.
- [2.4.1]: Create links to skip blocks of repeated material
        - I created a =skip-to-content= link hidden at the top each web page
          that allows keyboard or screen reader users to skip the navigation
          block.
- [2.4.6]: Provide descriptive headings
        - Each page contains hierarchical headers starting at =<h1>=.
- [3.1.1]: Use the language attribute on the HTML element
        - Each pages is defined with =<html lang=en-us>=.
- [3.1.4]: Provide an expansion of an abbreviation on the first occurrence
        - To the best of my ability, I have been reviewing all historical posts
          on this site and expanding abbreviations upon first use.
- [3.2]: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
        - This, and many other requirements, are resolved by a combination of
          (1) native browser functionality which works as expected since I am
          using semantic HTML, and (2) my use of a structure outline and logical
          content flow on each page of the site.

* Results

To confirm compliance, I chose /not/ to use one of the "free" accessibility
checker websites, since they often only test one page at a time, take a while to
run, and I just generally don't enjoy scanning my website with random services.

Instead, I used the [[https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/tools/#develop][IBM Equal Access Accessibility Checker]] extension on Firefox.
This allowed me to scan each page I wanted, stored my scans, and provided
in-depth results with links to guidance and suggestions for fixing each issue.

This was great as it showed me a handful of issues I hadn't caught previously.
However, the image above shows that my site is 94% compliant through *automated*
checks and I manually verified the remaining 6% of checks.

I performed these scans for all top-level pages on my website (home, about,
blog, services, about, salary, and now), as well as the three latest blog posts
to confirm compliance.

I'd love to test 100% of every page of my website one day and will continue to
strive to enhance my compliance with ARIA and WCAG.
