I recently came back from a winter break and have started working again... only
to immediately run into the dilemma of people sending me cliffhanger messages
again.

# No Hello

A year or two ago, I discovered [no hello](https://nohello.net/en/) and have
thought about it often since then. I've even sent it to a few people since then
(who wouldn't take offense to it).

I work in a fast-paced environment where efficiency is extremely valuable.
Therefore, I have always held a deep displeasure for conversations where people
start with "Hello" and then.

I searched back through my work messages and found that I received ~50 messages
from ~10 people last year from people that contained "hi", "hey", or
"hello" and did not contain any indication of the purpose of the conversation.
I also noticed that a few of the users were responsible for the large majority
of the cliffhangers.

There's no real point to this post, just a desparate request for people to
please stop doing this.
