This year in Emacs, I expect to do a lot. However, here are some actionable
goals for myself that should have a positive impact as I start out 2026.

* Dive Deeper into Org-Mode
- [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html][Org Agenda]]: Move beyond simple ~TODO~ lists. I want to implement a custom
  dashboard using ~org-super-agenda~ to group tasks by context rather than just
  file.
- [[https://github.com/gregsexton/ob-ipython][ob-ipython]]: Fully embrace Literate Programming. This year, my data analysis
  scripts live inside org blocks. No more scattered ~.py~ files for quick
  prototypes.
- [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Capture.html][Org Capture]]: Streamline my intake. I’m aiming for a "one-key" capture system
  that sorts ideas into the right buckets automatically using template hooks.

* Better Doom Configuration
- GitOps for Emacs: Come up with a solid base and use a GitOps-style workflow to
  ensure my environment is identical between home, work, and server.
- UI Refinement: Try new packages like ~spacious-padding~ to give the buffer
  some room to breathe. I'm also looking into ~svg-lib~ for cleaner-looking
  progress bars and icons.
