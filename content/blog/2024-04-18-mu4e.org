#+title: Email in Doom Emacs with Mu4e on macOS
#+description: 
#+slug: mu4e

This post was heavily inspired by [[https://macowners.club/posts/email-emacs-mu4e-macos/][Email setup in Emacs with Mu4e on macOS]], but
with my own tweaks for a single-account configuration and some Doom-specific
configurations.

* Overview

[[https://github.com/emacsmirror/mu4e][Mu4e]] is an Emacs-based email client based on [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/][mu]], an indexer that stores email in
the Maildir format.

This blog post covers the installation of Mu4e in Doom Emacs on macOS. This
guide should be very similar to GNU Emacs and Linux-based systems, with a few
tweaks required in the various configuration files.

* Installation

** Prerequisites

*** Create the Folder Structure

Start by creating the base folder structure:

#+begin_src sh
mkdir ~/.maildir
mkdir ~/.maildir/example      # use whatever name you want to call your email account
mkdir ~/.maildir/certificates # used to store system root certificates
#+end_src

*** Store Email Account Passwords in macOS Keychain

Next, I will be using the macOS Keychain to store my email account passwords
using the command below.

#+begin_src sh
security add-generic-password -s mu4e-example -a you@example.com -w
#+end_src

This will prompt you to input your password twice to confirm. Keep the
=mu4e-example= name in mind, as you will need to reference it later in the IMAP
and SMTP configuration files.

*** Store Root Certificates

In order to use IMAP and SMTP, we need to provide certificates to the local
services. We will use the macOS defaults for this.

1. Open =Keychain Access.app=.
2. Select =System Roots= in the sidebar.
3. Select all items with =CMD + a=.
4. Export selected items with =SHIFT + CMD + a= to the file
   =~/.maildir/certificates/root-certificates.pem=.

*** Install Dependencies

Install =mbsync= (via =isync=) to fetch emails via IMAP, =mu= to index emails,
and =msmtp= to send emails via SMTP.

#+begin_src sh
brew install mu isync msmtp
#+end_src

** Installing Mu4e

Within Doom Emacs, we can install Mu4e by enabling the package.

#+begin_src sh
nano ~/.doom.d/init.el
#+end_src

In this file, uncomment the =mu4e= line within the =:email= section. You can
also enable the =+org= and =+gmail= options if you prefer.

#+begin_src lisp
(doom! :input
       ...
       :email
       mu4e
       ;;(mu4e +org +gmail)
       ...
       (default +bindings +smartparens))
#+end_src

* Configuration

As an overall suggestion, I create the following configuration files in the
=~/.maildir= directory and using symlinks to their proper locations so that I
can backup and restore these files easily.

#+begin_src sh
touch ~/.maildir/.mbsyncrc && \
touch ~/.maildir/.msmtprc  && \
ln -s /Users/username/.maildir/.mbsyncrc /Users/username/.mbsyncrc && \
ln -s /Users/username/.maildir/.msmtprc /Users/username/.msmtprc
#+end_src

You can also create these files in your home directory and skip the symlinking
process above.

** IMAP

Next, let's configure =mbsync= in the file created above. Paste the following
information and customize it to match your mail provider's information.

#+begin_src sh
nano ~/.maildir/.mbsyncrc
#+end_src

#+begin_src conf
IMAPAccount example
Host imap.example.com
User dummy@example.com
PassCmd "security find-generic-password -s mu4e-example -a dummy@example.com -w"
Port 993
SSLType IMAPS
AuthMechs Login
CertificateFile ~/.maildir/certificates/root-certificates.pem

IMAPStore example-remote
Account example

MaildirStore example-local
SubFolders Verbatim
Path ~/.maildir/example/
Inbox ~/.maildir/example/INBOX

Channel example
Far :example-remote:
Near :example-local:
Patterns *
Create Near
Sync All
Expunge Both

#+end_src

** SMTP

Next, let's configured =msmtprc= in the file created above. Paste the following
information and customize it to match your mail provider's information.

#+begin_src sh
nano ~/.maildir/.msmtprc
#+end_src

#+begin_src conf
# Set default values for all the accounts.
defaults
logfile ~/.maildir/msmtp.log
tls_trust_file ~/.maildir/certificates/root-certificates.pem

# ======================================================================

account startmail
auth on
host smtp.startmail.com
port 465
protocol smtp
from hello@cleberg.net
user hello@cleberg.net
passwordeval security find-generic-password -s startmail -a hello@cleberg.net -w
tls on
tls_starttls off

# ======================================================================

account default : startmail
#+end_src

** Doom Emacs

Finally, we need to configure Doom Emacs to use the proper packages and set some
variables and functions.

#+begin_src sh
nano ~/.doom.d/config.el
#+end_src

#+begin_src lisp
;; load packages and programs
(use-package mu4e
  :load-path  "/Users/username/.emacs.d/modules/email/mu4e/")
(require 'smtpmail)
(setq mu4e-mu-binary (executable-find "mu"))

;; set base directory
(setq mu4e-maildir "~/.maildir")

;; sync imap servers
(setq mu4e-get-mail-command (concat (executable-find "mbsync") " -a"))

;; how often to sync in seconds
(setq mu4e-update-interval 300)

;; save attachments to defined directory
(setq mu4e-attachment-dir "~/Downloads")

;; rename files when moving - needed for mbsync:
(setq mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving t)

;; list of your email adresses:
(setq mu4e-user-mail-address-list '("you@example.com"))

;; check your ~/.maildir to see naming of subdirectories
(setq   mu4e-maildir-shortcuts
        '(("/example/INBOX" . ?e)
          ("/example/Sent" . ?E)))

(setq mu4e-contexts
      `(,(make-mu4e-context
          :name "example"
          :enter-func
          (lambda () (mu4e-message "Enter you@example.com context"))
          :leave-func
          (lambda () (mu4e-message "Leave you@example.com context"))
          :match-func
          (lambda (msg)
            (when msg
              (mu4e-message-contact-field-matches msg
                                                  :to "you@example.com")))
          :vars '((user-mail-address . "you@example.com")
                  (user-full-name . "Christian Cleberg")
                  ;; check your ~/.maildir to see how the subdirectories are called
                  ;; e.g `ls ~/.maildir/example'
                  (mu4e-drafts-folder . "/example/Drafts")
                  (mu4e-refile-folder . "/example/Archive")
                  (mu4e-sent-folder . "/example/Sent")
                  (mu4e-trash-folder . "/example/Trash")))))

(setq mu4e-context-policy 'pick-first) ;; start with the first (default) context;
(setq mu4e-compose-context-policy 'ask) ;; ask for context if no context matches;

;; gpg encryptiom & decryption:
;; this can be left alone
(require 'epa-file)
(epa-file-enable)
(setq epa-pinentry-mode 'loopback)
(auth-source-forget-all-cached)

;; don't keep message compose buffers around after sending:
(setq message-kill-buffer-on-exit t)

;; send function:
(setq send-mail-function 'sendmail-send-it
      message-send-mail-function 'sendmail-send-it)

;; send program:
(setq sendmail-program (executable-find "msmtp"))

;; select the right sender email from the context.
(setq message-sendmail-envelope-from 'header)

;; mu4e cc & bcc
(add-hook 'mu4e-compose-mode-hook
          (defun timu/add-cc-and-bcc ()
            "My Function to automatically add Cc & Bcc: headers.
    This is in the mu4e compose mode."
            (save-excursion (message-add-header "Cc:\n"))
            (save-excursion (message-add-header "Bcc:\n"))))

;; mu4e address completion
(add-hook 'mu4e-compose-mode-hook 'company-mode)
#+end_src

Be sure to sync Doom to update the current configurations.

#+begin_src sh
doom sync
#+end_src

If you have Doom open, execute =SPC h r r= to reload the new configurations.

* Initial Sync

Once you have configured all of the relevant files, you can perform an initial
sync. Note that you can perform syncing within Mu4e itself after this.

#+begin_src sh
mbsync -aV
#+end_src

Once you sync the data, you can index the emails.

#+begin_src sh
mu init -m ~/.maildir --my-address you@example.com && \
mu index
#+end_src

The emails will now to be ready to use!

* Screenshots

You can now launch Doom and open Mu4e with =SPC o m=. You can also explore the
Mu4e options with =SPC : mu4e=.

The home page shows various options and metadata about the account you've
opened.
