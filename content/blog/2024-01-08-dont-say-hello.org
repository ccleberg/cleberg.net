I recently came back from a winter break and have started working again... only
to immediately run into the dilemma of people sending me cliffhanger messages
again.

* No Hello

A year or two ago, I discovered [[https://nohello.net/en/][no hello]] and have thought about it often since
then. I've even sent it to a few people since then (who wouldn't take offense to
it).

I work in a fast-paced environment where efficiency is extremely valuable.
Therefore, I have always held a deep displeasure for conversations where people
start with "Hello" and then.

I searched back through my work messages and found that I received ~50 messages
from ~10 people last year from people that contained "hi", "hey", or "hello" and
did not contain any indication of the purpose of the conversation. I also
noticed that a few of the users were responsible for the large majority of the
cliffhangers.

There's no real point to this post, just a desparate request for people to
please stop doing this.
