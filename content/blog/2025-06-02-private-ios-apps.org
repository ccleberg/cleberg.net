#+slug:        private-ios-apps
#+filetags:    :ios:privacy:security:

In a world where our phones are extensions of ourselves, balancing convenience
with privacy can feel like a losing battle — especially on iOS, where platform
restrictions narrow the options. But it's not impossible. There's a growing
ecosystem of privacy-respecting apps, tools, and communities focused on helping
iPhone users take back some control.

Below is a curated list of privacy resources, directories, and testing tools
specifically useful for iOS. Whether you're looking for a better email client, a
trustworthy VPN, or simply places to learn more, these links are a solid
starting point.

#+begin_quote
*Note*: This list focuses solely on iOS-compatible resources and tools. No
Android comparisons here — just options for those of us living in Apple's walled
garden.
#+end_quote

* Email

First and foremost, I like to consider email as my first app on a new device.
However, the iOS market lacks a wealth of open-source and private email clients.
There are a few options, such as Proton Mail and Tuta, which are open source and
private, but they lock you into their ecosystem. Tuta doesn't allow for custom
domains and neither allows SMTP/IMAP access.

Canary Mail is a decent option, as it is a classic SMTP/IMAP client - and does
more than most as it's one of the only PGP email clients on iOS - but is closed
source and the company behind it seems more focused on AI than privacy.

- [[https://proton.me/mail][Proton Mail]] - A more mainstream-feeling app with PGP support built-in. Good if
  you're looking for something that feels like Apple Mail but with privacy
  upgrades.
- [[https://tuta.com/][Tuta]] - Tuta (formerly Tutanota) takes privacy a step further by encrypting
  subject lines, message content, attachments, and calendar events. It also
  avoids using phone numbers or third-party services for registration. The iOS
  app is reliable for the basics. Downsides: no IMAP/SMTP support, so you can't
  plug it into your own mail clients, and notifications require a premium plan
  if you want them in real-time. Great if you care about metadata exposure.
- [[https://canarymail.io/][Canary Mail]] - A more polished, user-friendly email client that supports
  end-to-end encryption using PGP and their own “SecureSend” feature for
  encrypted messages. Canary works with multiple mail providers (Gmail, Outlook,
  etc.), so it's more of a privacy enhancement for existing services rather than
  a private mail provider itself. Downsides: it's a proprietary, closed-source
  app, and some privacy features require a subscription. Better than stock Mail
  for security, but you're still trusting their implementation.

Another suggestion is to use a browser-based web client. You can install browser
mail clients as progressive web apps (PWAs). For example, I have been using
[[https://webmail.migadu.com][webmail.migadu.com]] as a progressive email app for a while now and it works great
for my purposes.

This allows for access to your email without installing an application that
access native APIs or other potential data sources you may be concerned about.
This is especially important if you're concerned about allowing permissions to
device APIs, non-reproducible buils from the App Store, or mobile device
fingerprints.

Lastly, [[https://blog.thunderbird.net/2025/05/thunderbird-for-mobile-april-2025-progress-report/][Thunderbird iOS]] is under development. Keep an eye out for an alpha or
beta release later in 2025 or early 2026. I have a feeling that once Thunderbird
iOS is available, it will easily become the best option for email on iOS.

#+begin_quote
*I use*: Web-based email on iOS and Thunderbird on my desktop. Once Thunderbird
releases for iOS, I will probably use that.
#+end_quote

* Browsers

Your browser is basically the front door to the internet — and also the window,
mailbox, and security camera. It's where trackers, ads, fingerprinting scripts,
and data leaks happen most often. Even on a locked-down phone, if your browser
isn't protecting your traffic, your personal info can quietly leak out through
third-party scripts, embedded media, and background connections. Choosing a
privacy-respecting browser is one of the most impactful decisions you can make
for mobile privacy.

- [[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firefox-focus-privacy-browser/id1055677337][Firefox Focus]] - A stripped-down, no-nonsense browser from Mozilla. It
  automatically blocks trackers, erases your browsing history with a tap, and
  skips extras like tabs or bookmarks. Great for one-off searches and quick
  visits to privacy-sensitive sites.
- [[https://duckduckgo.com/app][DuckDuckGo]] - A full-featured private browser with built-in tracker blocking,
  HTTPS upgrades, and a clear data button. It also integrates DuckDuckGo search
  and email protection. Solid for daily use if you don't want your browsing
  activity tied to a bigger tech company.
- [[https://onionbrowser.com/][Onion Browser]] & [[https://orbot.app/][Orbot]] - Your best bet for anonymous browsing on iOS. Onion
  Browser routes traffic over Tor, while Orbot can proxy other apps system-wide
  through Tor. Slower than normal browsers, but excellent for masking your IP
  and avoiding surveillance.
- [[https://brave.com/][Brave]] - Privacy-focused with ad and tracker blocking built-in, Brave also runs
  its own private search engine and supports things like Tor tabs (on desktop,
  not iOS). On iOS, it's basically a privacy-enhanced Safari/WebKit shell —
  better than nothing, but subject to Apple's browser engine limits.
- [[https://www.apple.com/safari/][Safari]] (with caveats) - Surprisingly decent for privacy if you tweak the
  settings. Enable “Prevent Cross-Site Tracking,” block all cookies, and disable
  preload for best results. Still, it's tied to your Apple ID and iCloud syncing
  unless you're careful, so don't treat it as anonymous. For a great baseline
  configuration, read PrivacyGuide's [[https://www.privacyguides.org/en/mobile-browsers/#safari-ios][Safari]] section.

#+begin_quote
*I use*: Hardened safari in private mode for every day use, and Onion Browser
for anonymous browsing.
#+end_quote

* Messaging

If you're trying to keep conversations off surveillance infrastructure, choosing
the right messaging app is crucial. Between metadata collection, insecure cloud
backups, and shady server practices, most mainstream chat apps aren't
privacy-friendly by design. On iOS, you're a little more limited than on
Android, but there are still solid options built around end-to-end encryption
and metadata minimization.

- [[https://signal.org/][Signal]] - The gold standard for secure messaging. Open source, end-to-end
  encrypted, and runs its own private push notification infrastructure so Apple
  can't read your message content. Downsides: phone number required for signup
  (a known metadata weak point).
- [[https://simplex.chat/][SimpleX]] - A decentralized, phone-number-free messaging system. Uses anonymous
  message relays and asymmetric keys. Great for pseudonymous chats or if you're
  tired of number-based identity systems.
- [[https://getsession.org/][Session]] - A fork of Signal's protocol that eliminates phone numbers entirely.
  Routes messages through a decentralized onion network (like Tor). Excellent
  for metadata resistance, though message delivery can sometimes lag.
- [[https://element.io/][Element]] - Based on the Matrix protocol, offering decentralized, federated
  chat. Great for groups and communities, with optional end-to-end encryption. A
  little heavier on resources than the others.

Privacy-friendly messaging isn't perfect on iOS — background sync restrictions
and notification relay challenges exist — but these tools will cover most needs
while keeping your data away from corporate servers.

#+begin_quote
*I use*: Signal for private chats with known people, and Matrix for group chats.
#+end_quote

* VPNs & Networking

Network traffic is where most surveillance happens. Even with encrypted
messaging and browsers, your IP address and DNS queries reveal a lot. A good VPN
or alternative network routing tool masks this, but not all VPNs are
trustworthy. Avoid “free” services or those lacking transparency.

- [[https://mullvad.net/][Mullvad]] - A no-logs VPN that doesn't require an email or personal info to
  create an account. Consistently audited and privacy-focused. Their app is
  excellent on iOS.
- [[https://www.torproject.org/][Tor]] - Best for anonymity rather than everyday VPN use. Routes your traffic
  over three relays, obscuring both source and destination. Slower, but
  unmatched for high-risk browsing.
- [[https://yggdrasilnetwork.org/installation][Yggdrasil]] - An experimental, encrypted, peer-to-peer mesh network. Less
  polished for mobile but useful for hobbyists or building private networks
  between devices.

If you can't self-host or build your own mesh, Mullvad is hands-down the
cleanest option here. There are other VPN options available, but I haven't
tested them all so I will simply put my vote for Mullvad here and let you
research other options if you don't want to use Mullvad.

#+begin_quote
*I use*: Mullvad for 24/7 usage, and Tor when anonymity is required.
#+end_quote

* Password Management

Weak, reused passwords are still one of the biggest risks for personal security.
A good password manager makes it possible to use strong, unique credentials
without memorizing them all.

- [[https://bitwarden.com/][Bitwarden]] - Open source, audited, and free to self-host. The iOS app
  integrates with system autofill and Face ID. Solid for most users.
- [[https://keepassium.com/][KeePassium]] - A KeePass-compatible client for iOS. Local database storage,
  optional cloud sync, and no external accounts. Excellent if you want full
  control over your credential store.
- [[https://keepassxc.org/][KeePassXC]] + Syncing Solution - If you already use KeePass on desktop, sync
  your database with a secure method like [[https://cryptomator.org/][Cryptomator]]-protected cloud storage,
  Syncthing, or local-only transfers.

Good password hygiene matters more than people realize, and these apps give you
control over your vault.

#+begin_quote
*I use*: Bitwarden Families ($40/year) to protect passwords, passkeys, TOTP
codes, and secure notes for my family. If I were using a solution solely for
myself, I would prefer KeePassXC + Syncthing.
#+end_quote

* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA is essential, but relying on SMS codes or untrusted proprietary apps defeats
the point. Use open, local, encrypted authenticators where possible.

- [[https://bitwarden.com/products/authenticator/][Bitwarden Authenticator]] - Integrates with the password manager or works
  standalone. Encrypted backups through Bitwarden.
- [[https://ente.io/auth/][Ente Auth]] - Open source, end-to-end encrypted TOTP manager. Syncs encrypted
  via Ente's infrastructure.
- [[https://www.tofuauth.com/][Tofu]] - Minimal, offline-first TOTP app. No cloud, no telemetry.
- [[https://raivo-otp.com/][Raivo OTP]] - Open source, native iOS app with secure iCloud backups. Clean
  interface.
- [[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384][OTP Auth]] - A longstanding, trusted TOTP manager with encrypted backups and
  Apple Watch support. Not open source.

I recommend pairing one of these with strong passwords and a VPN for everyday
security.

#+begin_quote
*I use*: Bitwarden Authenticator, previously OTP Auth.
#+end_quote

* Notes & Personal Data

iCloud Notes and Google Keep aren't exactly privacy havens. If you're storing
sensitive personal notes, account details, or journal entries, opt for
encrypted, local-first apps.

- [[https://beorgapp.com/][Beorg]] - An Org-mode-compatible outliner and task manager for iOS. Great for
  Emacs fans and those managing plaintext files.
- [[https://obsidian.md/][Obsidian]] - A local Markdown-based notes app. All data stays on your device
  unless you opt for Obsidian Sync (or your own setup).
- [[https://standardnotes.com/][Standard Notes]] - End-to-end encrypted notes, with cross-platform sync. Good if
  you want a straightforward, secure cloud service.
- [[https://joplinapp.org/][Joplin]] - Open source, Markdown notes with optional encryption and cloud sync
  (Nextcloud, Dropbox, etc).

These options help decouple your data from major cloud platforms while keeping
notes portable and encrypted.

#+begin_quote
*I use*: Beorg, since I love org-mode and no longer use markdown.
#+end_quote

* Photos & Media

Your camera roll quietly feeds metadata and images to iCloud by default. If you
want to self-host or encrypt your photo library, here's what works on iOS. At a
minimum, I suggest disabling iCloud for the Photos app, so the data stays local
on your device.

- [[https://immich.app/][Immich (self-hosted)]] - Open source, feature-rich, self-hosted photo manager
  with facial recognition and live photo support. Requires a home server.
- [[https://ente.io/][Ente Photos]] - End-to-end encrypted photo storage with iOS and web apps. Paid
  plans, but privacy-first infrastructure.

Good privacy photos apps are rare on iOS — these two are the standout options
right now.

#+begin_quote
*I use*: Immich for all photos.
#+end_quote

* Encryption Utilities

If you're handling sensitive files, you need a proper encryption utility to lock
them down.

- [[https://cryptomator.org/][Cryptomator]] - Open source, encrypted cloud storage vaults. Integrates with
  most cloud providers and works locally.
- [[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instant-pgp/id1497433694][Instant PGP]] - PGP key generation, import/export, and encrypted message/file
  creation. Handy for old-school secure comms.

If you're serious about privacy, encrypted storage and messaging layers like
these are essential.

#+begin_quote
*I use*: Cryptomator when syncing sensitive data over Syncthing. I no longer
require Instant PGP since Migadu's webmail client (SnappyMail) supports PGP.
#+end_quote

* News & Social

Mainstream news and social apps leak all kinds of usage metadata, even when
you're just lurking. These tools let you follow content with less exposure.

- [[https://netnewswire.com/][NetNewsWire]] - Free, open source RSS reader for iOS. Follow sites without
  tracking.
- [[https://www.talklittle.com/three-cheers/][ThreeCheers]] - Privacy-friendly Reddit client for iOS. No official API calls,
  built-in filtering.
- [[https://getvoyager.app/][Voyager]] - Clean, independent Mastodon client.
- [[https://joinmastodon.org/][Mastodon]] - Federated, open source alternative to Twitter.
- [[https://joinpeertube.org/][PeerTube]] - Decentralized video platform, accessible via web or PWA.
- [[https://pixelfed.org/][Pixelfed]] - Federated, open source alternative to Instagram.

If you're going to be online, at least let it be on your terms.

#+begin_quote
*I use*: NetNewsWire (via FreshRSS) for RSS feeds, and Voyager for Lemmy. I have
used all of these apps and they are great, but I am not very active on social
sites.
#+end_quote

* Final Thoughts

This isn't about paranoia — it's about awareness. Every app you use, every
service you sign into, quietly collects and trades your data. iOS makes true
anonymity harder than other platforms, but these tools and services give you a
fighting chance to keep your personal life personal.

If you have other privacy-friendly iOS tools you enjoy, [[mailto:hello@cleberg.net][email me]] — I'm always
looking for new things to test.
