Shout-out to [[https://baty.net/posts/2025/10/using-aerc-for-email/][Jack Baty]] for inspiring me to write about my =aerc-mail= client
after chatting about it over email recently!

* Overview

[[https://aerc-mail.org/][aerc]] is a text user interface (TUI) email client with intuitive defaults, easy
setup, and hassle-free operations. This post will walk through my personal
configuration for aerc on macOS.

* Installation

Since I am on macOS, I opted to install aerc from Homebrew. There are build
options for additional modules if you build from source, but I am okay with the
default options.

You can view the information about the package prior to installing it, if you
wish:

#+begin_src sh
brew info aerc
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
==> aerc: stable 0.21.0 (bottled), HEAD

build-error: 3 (30 days)
#+end_src

Once you confirm you want to install this package, run the following:

#+begin_src sh
brew install aerc
#+end_src

* First-Time Wizard

When you run aerc for the first time, an IMAP & SMTP wizard will walk you
through a basic setup for your email account(s).

On macOS, aerc will save your configuration files in the following location:
=~/Library/Preferences/aerc=.

I tried to create a =~/.config/aerc= directory, but the Library directory above
took precedence. If you truly need to keep your files in =~/.config=, you could
probably symlink that to the Library location. However, I accepted my fate and
will just edit the files within the Library directory.

* Configuration

Once you have installed and setup aerc for the first time, you can configure the
client and account settings.

As noted above, I will be working within the Library directory that aerc
defaults to when installed via brew.

#+begin_src sh
cd ~/Library/Preferences/aerc
#+end_src

This directory should contain the following files. You can open the
=accounts.conf= file to confirm it contains the information you input during the
wizard process.

| File            | Purpose                                                     |
|-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| =accounts.conf= | Contains account-specific settings for IMAP & SMTP accounts |
| =aerc.conf=     | Contains program-wide settings                              |
| =binds.conf=    | Contains key bindings for aerc                              |

I'll share my personal configuration, which is close to the defaults that
existed at the time of writing this post.

=accounts.conf=

This is the information from the wizard. The only further customization I
provided is the default signature file to be appended to each message I compose.

#+begin_src conf
[Personal]
source         = imaps://hello%40cleberg.net:PASSWORD@imap.migadu.com
outgoing       = smtps://hello%40cleberg.net:PASSWORD@smtp.migadu.com
default        = INBOX
from           = Christian Cleberg <hello@cleberg.net>
copy-to        = Sent
cache-headers  = true
signature-file = /Users/cmc/Library/Preferences/aerc/sigs/default
#+end_src

=sigs/default=

Any content within this file will be appended to my messages, as noted above.

#+begin_src text
Christian Cleberg <hello@cleberg.net>
GPG: 3917 973F B159 BBB8 6194 5385 69451A51 7AC0 CB37
#+end_src

=aerc.conf=

This contains quite a few customizations for my preferences related to
downloads, encryption, mouse controls, editor, and message composition.

#+begin_src conf
[general]
# Prefer downloads to be saved to the Downloads folder
default-save-path=~/Downloads
# Use GPG for PGP encryption
pgp-provider=gpg

[ui]
# Enable mouse controls for scrolling, paging, etc.
mouse-enabled=true

[statusline]
[viewer]
# Use emacs instead of vi
pager=/usr/local/bin/emacs_viewer

[compose]
# Use emacs instead of vi
editor=emacs
# Add Cc as a default field to view each time I compose a message
header-layout=To|From,Cc,Subject
# Allow me to edit headers when composing (so I can customize From address)
edit-headers=true
# Warn me if I mentioned these words but don't attach a file
empty-subject-warning=true
no-attachment-warning=^[^>]*attach(ed|ment)

[openers]

[templates]
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
*IMPORTANT*: If you use the =pager= option above that I'm using, you will need
 to create the =emacs_viewer= file as well.
#+end_quote

You can create the file following my process below, which will create an
executable in the location specified in my =aerc.conf= file. I put it in
=/usr/local/bin=, but you can put it anywhere as long as it exists in the file
path specific within your configuration file.

#+begin_src sh
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/emacs_viewer
#+end_src

Paste this inside the file:

#+begin_src sh
#!/bin/bash
emacs -nw - < "$1"
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/emacs_viewer
#+end_src

=binds.conf=

Finally, here are the key bindings. I did not change these, but I'm showing them
here in case you have an issue and want to see the defaults.

#+begin_src conf
# Binds are of the form <key sequence> = <command to run>
# To use '=' in a key sequence, substitute it with "Eq": "<Ctrl+Eq>"
# If you wish to bind #, you can wrap the key sequence in quotes: "#" = quit

* Operation

Now that I have configured the program to my liking, I can run =aerc= in my
terminal and see my changes reflected!

Personally, I keep aerc running in a terminal at all times, since it has the
operation to ring a bell when a new message arrives.

The mailbox views and composition screens are fairly standard, but it does a
great job at displaying information effectively.

All in all, I love aerc and far prefer it to my previous client (neomutt). In
certain cases, Thunderbird is more convenient, but I don't find myself opening
it at all lately. I will definitely update this post in the future if I find
anything extraordinary to add about aerc.
