* Introduction

As trends have shown, the auditing and assurance world is increasingly becoming
overwhelmed with topics like [[https://kpmg.com/xx/en/what-we-do/services/ai/trusted-ai-framework.html][AI]], [[https://pcaobus.org/Documents/Audits-Involving-Cryptoassets-Spotlight.pdf][Digital Assets]], [[https://kpmg.com/us/en/articles/2023/building-trust-cloud-environments.html][Cloud]], [[https://kpmg.com/us/en/articles/2023/role-of-internal-audit-devops.html][DevOps]], and [[https://kpmg.com/ch/en/insights/technology/audit-transformation.html][Automation]].

While these trends are rapidly transforming businesses and industries, audit
firms and departments are working hard to ensure they stay aligned with business
objectives.

Throughout my career, I've seen topics like "AI" evolve from LLM-based projects
used by data scientists to everyday tools accessible to the masses and integrated
directly into business operations.

As an auditor, skills in emerging technologies are an invaluable asset that can
translate into massive career opportunities and long-term job security.

I have experienced this firsthand as topics like automation, AI, cloud
assurance, and DevOps have kept me in a secure position with significant potential
for growth and learning.

In this post, I'm going to walk through the process of becoming skilled in an
emerging technology and how to translate that into a rewarding audit career.

* Step 1: Build a Strong Foundation in Audit & Risk

To start, I want to note that learning about emerging technologies is only
useful if you already have a base in auditing. You can't audit a cloud
environment with cloud knowledge alone — you also need to understand the
fundamentals of auditing.

If you find that you're highly technical already, focus your time on learning
audit standards and guidance.

You can customize this to any frameworks applicable to your company or industry,
but these are generally the baseline for an audit career:

- [[https://www.coso.org/Pages/default.aspx][COSO]]
- [[https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework][NIST CSF]]
- [[https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html][ISO/IEC 27001]]
- [[https://pcaobus.org/][PCAOB]]
- [[https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/assurance][AICPA]]

The consistent theme throughout these frameworks is that audits rely on
independent parties who provide consistent documentation, appropriate
considerations of risks and responses, scoping, and reporting.

One of the easiest ways to get this knowledge is by doing. While it can be
challenging, the concept is straightforward. If you are working in a role within
a department like internal audit, external audit, risk, compliance, etc., focus
on performing your role exceptionally and continuously challenge yourself to
learn more about audit and risk each day you work.

* Step 2: Learn the Tech That's Changing the Profession

Getting to the point of this post, there's a wide range of technologies transforming the audit
world. To accelerate career growth and discover a niche you enjoy, I've compiled
a short list of topics that are currently (1) growing in demand, (2) have a need
for more experts within the audit field, and (3) are expected to remain relevant.

- *Automation & Data Analytics*: Alteryx, Python, Power BI, Tableau
- *Cloud*: AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM
- *Blockchain*: Decentralization, smart contracts, chain of custody
- *DevOps*: Azure DevOps, CI/CD, DevSecOps, GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins
- *AI/ML*: AI in business, AI in auditing, AI assurance

*Pro Tip*: Tackle one area at a time. You don't need to become an expert, but
make sure you learn enough to conceptualize the technologies and logic behind
the topics you're auditing.

If you focus on one at a time, you can dedicate time to that sole topic to
understand it more deeply before moving on to the next.

* Step 3: Earn Certifications That Signal Credibility

If you don't have much experience, or can't demonstrate your knowledge in a
particular area due to job constraints or otherwise, you can utilize courses
and certifications to boost your credibility. This is an effective way to
establish credibility and demonstrate your qualifications.

- [[https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa][CISA (Certified Information Systems Auditor)]]: Core certification for IT
  auditors covering systems, controls, governance, and assurance.
- [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/azure-fundamentals/][Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)]] / [[https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/][AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner]]: Entry-level
  cloud certifications covering core cloud concepts, services, pricing, and
  security.
- [[https://www.alteryx.com/certification/designer-core][Alteryx Designer Core Certification]]: Validates your ability to build data
  prep, blending, and analytics workflows in Alteryx.
- [[https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science][IBM Data Science Professional Certificate]] (via Coursera): Teaches data
  science fundamentals, Python, SQL, and AI basics; popular for aspiring data
  auditors and analysts.
- Entry-level technical certifications:
  - [[https://pythoninstitute.org/pcep][PCEP (Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer) by Python Institute]]
  - [[https://www.edx.org/learn/artificial-intelligence][AI certifications on edX]] covering foundations, governance, and AI ethics.
  - [[https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-blockchain-professional-expert/][Certified Blockchain Expert]]

I have earned the following certifications and have seen great responses
throughout my career due to the credibility they provided in these focus areas:

- GitLab Certified Git Associate
- GitHub Foundations
- Alteryx Designer Core Certified
- Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals
- Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)
- Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer (PCEP)
- Data Science Professional Certificate
- Cybersecurity Audit Certificate

* Step 4: Join Emerging Tech Projects and Pilots

Once you have the knowledge and, if applicable, the credentials to showcase your
skills, you need the chance to network and show what you can do.

To do this, I recommend joining a group focused on the topic you're passionate
about. Normally, this is easiest within your own company. However, sometimes you
may need to seek other opportunities in your community or online to find the
project that works best for you.

- Seek opportunities internally: AI pilots, automation and data analysis
  projects, blockchain initiatives.
- If they don't exist — propose them.
- Suggest automating risk assessments, piloting AI tools, or testing continuous
  assurance routines.

*Why this matters*: These projects become resume differentiators and position
you for leadership roles.

* Step 5: Build a Network of Tech-Savvy Auditors & Consultants

As a segue from Step 4, ensure that you have a network of like-minded
individuals who can challenge you and expose you to new ideas. This helps keep
you sharp and open to innovation. Some suggestions include:

- Join ISACA, local AI/ML meetups, blockchain working groups.
- Engage with emerging tech communities on LinkedIn — share posts, comment on
  thought leadership, or publish insights.

* Step 6: Stay Curious and Keep Learning

Last, but not least, keep learning! While you may feel like you know everything,
there's always more to explore. I enjoy revisiting known problems from different
perspectives, as it's helped me grow and realize that alternative approaches
often yield better results with experience.

- The landscape is changing rapidly — stay current on AI regulation, blockchain
  security, cloud assurance frameworks, or whatever interests you.
- Subscribe to niche newsletters (e.g., The Cybersecurity 202, AI Ethics
  Weekly).
- Take one course or certification per year to stay sharp.

* Closing

You don't need to be an engineer or software developer to thrive in technology —
but you do need to understand enough to assess risk. With these steps, I have
found a wonderful and fulfilling career, and I know you can too.
