* What is Agile Auditing?

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development][Agile]], the
collaborative philosophy behind many software development methods, has
been picking up steam as a beneficial tool to use in the external and
internal auditing world.

This blog post will walk through commonly used terms within Agile,
Scrum, and Kanban in order to translate these terms and roles into
audit-specific terms.

Whether your team is in charge of a financial statement audit, an
attestation (SOC 1, SOC 2, etc.), or a unique internal audit, the terms
used throughout this post should still apply.

* Agile

To start, I'll take a look at Agile.

#+begin_quote
The Agile methodology is a project management approach that involves
breaking the project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration
and improvement. Teams follow a cycle of planning, executing, and
evaluating.
#+end_quote

While this approach may seem familiar to what audit teams have
historically done, an audit team must make distinct changes in their
mentality and how they approach and manage a project.

** Agile Values

The Agile Manifesto, written in 2001 at a summit in Utah, contain a set
of four main values that comprise the Agile approach:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4. Responding to change over following a plan.

Beyond the four values,
[[https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html][twelve principles]] were
also written as part of the summit.

In order to relate these values to an audit or attestation engagement,
we need to shift the focus from software development to the main goal of
an engagement: completing sufficient audit testing to address to
relevant risks over the processes and controls at hand.

Audit Examples:

- Engagement teams must value the team members, client contacts, and
  their interactions over the historical processes and tools that have
  been used.
- Engagement teams must value a final report that contains sufficient
  audit documentation over excessive documentation or scope creep.
- Engagement teams must collaborate with the audit clients as much as
  feasible to ensure that both sides are constantly updated with current
  knowledge of the engagement's status and any potential findings,
  rather than waiting for pre-set meetings or the end of the engagement
  to communicate.
- Engagement teams must be able to respond to change in an engagement's
  schedule, scope, or environment to ensure that the project is
  completed in a timely manner and that all relevant areas are tested.
  - In terms of an audit department's portfolio, they must be able to
    respond to changes in their company's or client's environment and be
    able to dynamically change their audit plan accordingly.

* Scrum

The above section discusses the high-level details of the Agile
philosophy and how an audit team can potentially mold that mindset into
the audit world, but how does a team implement these ideas?

There are many methods that use an Agile mindset, but I prefer
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)][Scrum]].
Scrum is a framework based on Agile that enables a team to work through
a project through a series of roles, ceremonies, artifacts, and values.

Let's dive into each of these individually.

** Scrum Team

A scrum project is only as good as the team running the project.
Standard scrum teams are separated into three distinct areas:

1. *Product Owner (Client Contact)*: The client contact is the audit
   equivalent of the product owner in Scrum. They are responsible for
   partnering with the engagement or audit team to ensure progress is
   being made, priorities are established, and clear guidance is given
   when questions or findings arise within each sprint.
2. *Scrum Master (Engagement Lead)*: The engagement or audit team lead
   is responsible for coaching the team and the client contact on the
   scrum process, tracking team progress against plan, scheduling
   necessary resources, and helping remove obstacles.
3. *Scrum Developers (Engagement Members)*: The engagement or audit team
   is the set of team members responsible for getting the work done.
   These team members will work on each task, report progress, resolve
   obstacles, and collaborate with other team members and the client
   contact to ensure goals are being met.

** Scrum Ceremonies

Scrum ceremonies are events that are performed on a regular basis.

1. *Sprint Planning*: The team works together to plan the upcoming
   sprint goal and which user stories (tasks) will be added to the
   sprint to achieve that goal.
2. *Sprint*: The time period, typically at least one week and no more
   than one month in length, where the team works on the stories and
   anything in the backlog.
3. *Daily Scrum*: A very short meeting held each day, typically 15
   minutes, to quickly emphasize alignment on the sprint goal and plan
   the next 24 hours. Each team member may share what they did the day
   before, what they'll do today, and any obstacles to their work.
4. *Sprint Review*: At the end of each sprint, the team will gather and
   discuss the progress, obstacles, and backlog from the previous
   sprint.
5. *Sprint Retrospective*: More specific than the sprint review, the
   retrospective is meant to discuss what worked and what did not work
   during the sprint. This may be processes, tools, people, or even
   things related to the Scrum ceremonies.

One additional ceremony that may be applicable is organizing the
backlog. This is typically the responsibility of the engagement leader
and is meant to prioritize and clarify what needs to be done to complete
items in the backlog.

** Artifacts

While artifacts are generally not customizable in the audit world (i.e.,
each control test must include some kind of working paper with evidence
supporting the test results), I wanted to include some quick notes on
associating scrum artifact terms with an audit.

1. *Product Backlog*: This is the overall backlog of unfinished audit
   tasks from all prior sprints.
2. *Sprint Backlog*: This is the backlog of unfinished audit tasks from
   one individual sprint.
3. *Increment*: This is the output of each sprint - generally this is
   best thought of as any documentation prepared during the sprint, such
   as risk assessments, control working papers, deficiency analysis,
   etc.

* Kanban

Last but not least, Kanban is a methodology that relies on boards to
categorize work into distinct, descriptive categories that allow an
agile or scrum team to effectively plan the work of a sprint or project.
