* Fedora i3's Login Manager

Since I use the i3 spin of Fedora Workstation, I don't like to have a
login manager installed by default. As of the current version of Fedora
i3, the default login manager is LightDM.

If this is no longer the case, you can search for currently-installed
packages with the following command and see if you can identify a
different login manager.

#+begin_src sh
sudo dnf list installed
#+end_src

* Removing the Login Manager

In order to remove the login manager, simply uninstall the package.

#+begin_src sh
sudo dnf remove lightdm
#+end_src

* Launching i3 Manually

In order to launch i3 manually, you need to set up your X session
properly. To start, create or edit the =~/.xinitrc= file to include the
following at the bottom.

#+begin_src config
exec i3
#+end_src

Now, whenever you log in to the TTY, you can launch your desktop with
the following command.

#+begin_src sh
startx
#+end_src
