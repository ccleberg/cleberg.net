* Tuesday, Twosday

I'm taking a break from my usual technology-related posts and writing
about something a little more enjoyable today.

Today is Tuesday, February 22nd, 2022. Today is 02-22-2022. Today is
Twosday.

Let's look at everything that fell in place today:

1. Written in the =m-dd-yy= or =dd-m-yy= formats, today is 2-22-22 or
   22-2-22, which is a neat little palindrome in either format. (The
   last ubiquitous six-digit palindrome was 1-11-11.)
2. Today is Tuesday, which is why everyone is using the nickname Twosday
   to call out these similarities.
3. Falling on Tuesday means today is the 2nd day of the week (for most
   cultures. For the US, it's the 3rd day of the week since we start on
   Sunday).
4. The only culture I could find with a connection to a =2= is that some
   Slavic languages derived their version of Tuesday from the Old Church
   Slavonic word =въторъ=, meaning "the second."
5. Written in the classic monospaced, digital font (think of digital
   clocks from the 80s/90s), there is nice symmetry to the numbers
   ([[https://img.cleberg.net/blog/20220222-tuesday/digital_font.png][view

6. This one isn't naturally-occurring, but it seems people around the
   world are celebrating the day. For example, a group is putting
   together
   [[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2-22-22-a-collective-wedding-ceremony-at-the-state-capitol-tickets-211434605597][a
   wedding of 222 couples at the California State Capitol in
   Sacramento]], concluding at exactly 2:22 PM. These couples will
   record their marriage dates as 2-22-22 2:22 PM. Tickets were on sale
   for $222.22.
