* Trying out Asahi Linux

While debating if I should find a replacement laptop and get rid of my Macbook
Pro, I decided to try [[https://asahilinux.org/][Asahi Linux]].

To put the bottom line up front, I love the experience and support for popular
features has come a long way since I originally checked out their website a few
years ago.

From Asahi's website, as seen below, I noticed that almost all targeted features
are now supported. This is a great jump from the state it was at in 2022 - 2023
when I last checked.

** Installation

Luckily, the installation process is as simple as getting started with a single
command:

#+begin_src shell
curl https://alx.sh | sh
#+end_src

This script will walk you through the standard installation steps to define the
size of the Linux partition, define your user and hostname, and give you
instructions on how to boot from the new operating system (OS).

Once the script completes, it will ask you to completely shut down the device,
boot into the Startup Options menu, and follow a handful of prompts to enable
your new OS.

** Initial Thoughts

By default, the installer suggests using the KDE (as does the online community),
so I opted to try KDE. Historically, I have always been a Gnome user when
utilizing a fully graphical desktop environment (DE), but I'm up for trying
something new.

KDE on Asahi works wonderfully and supports all of the generic features I'd
expect from a vanilla installation:

- Snap to tile
- Theming
- Graphical updates
- Sensible default applications (Dolphin, Firefox, KMail, Konsole, KWrite)
- Support for battery percentages, keyboard backlight control, and miscellaneous
  sensor controls

** Software Support

One thing to keep in mind is that Apple silicon chips (M*) are based on the ARM
architecture, which means you will need to install software that supports ARM
(i.e., ARM64/aarch64).

While I have run into a handful of applications that do not have an ARM package
available, it is not as difficult as it used to be to find suitable apps for all
purposes on ARM.

* Final Thoughts

I am still in the early days of testing out Asahi Linux, so I will be sure to
come back and update this post occasionally, but I am very happy with the user
experience so far. Everything is smooth and I am still able to experience the
great hardware of the Macbook with the software of Linux.

In addition to the screenshots above, I have been testing out [[https://swaywm.org/][SwayWM]], which is
slightly more difficult to configure after being away for Linux for a couple
years. Regardless, it's working on Asahi as well and seems to be suitable for
daily driving.

Overall, I am glad there's continued support for Asahi and will be supporting
them through their Open Collective going forward. Cheers to the Asahi team on
such a great product.
