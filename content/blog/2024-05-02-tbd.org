* Trying out Asahi Linux

While debating if I should find a replacement laptop and get rid of my Macbook
Pro, I decided to try [[https://asahilinux.org/][Asahi Linux]].

To put the bottom line up front, I love the experience and support for popular
features has come a long way since I originally checked out their website a few
years ago.

From Asahi's website, as seen below, I noticed that almost all targeted features
are now supported. This is a great jump from the state it was at in 2022 - 2023
when I last checked.

** Installation

Luckily, the installation process is as simple as getting started with a single
command:

#+begin_src shell
curl https://alx.sh | sh
#+end_src

This script will walk you through the standard installation steps to define the
size of the Linux partition, define your user and hostname, and give you
instructions on how to boot from the new operating system (OS).

Once the script completes, it will ask you to completely shut down the device,
boot into the Startup Options menu, and follow a handful of prompts to enable
your new OS.
