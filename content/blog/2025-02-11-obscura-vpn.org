* What is Obscura?

[[https://obscura.net/][Obscura]] is a new VPN offering that's [[https://mullvad.net/en/blog/mullvad-partnered-with-obscura-vpn][partnered with Mullvad]] to provide a unique
service: a VPN that "can't log your activity" due to the fact that it uses
Obscura servers for initial traffic routing and then passes off the traffic to
Mullvad's WireGuard servers as exit nodes.

This two-party VPN protocol allows you to use Obscura to relay your traffic, but
they don't see your traffic. On the other hand, the exit nodes from Mullvad will
see where you're connecting but cannot tell who you are as your traffic will
come directly from Obscura servers with other users.

* Privacy Features

One of the things I look for when considering a VPN are privacy features
intended to benefit users. Here are the features I love about Obscura:

- Two-party VPN protocol with Mullvad's servers
- No email required for sign-up
- No credit card required, crypto options available
- Open source [[https://github.com/Sovereign-Engineering/obscuravpn-client][repository]] is available
- [[http://ngmmbxlzfpptluh4tbdt57prk3zxmq4ztew7l2whmg7hkqaof2nzf7id.onion/][Tor website available]]
- Transparent display of the exit server's public key (see the Location page in
  the app) so you can verify with Mullvad that you're connect via a genuine
  Mullvad exit node using [[https://mullvad.net/en/servers][Mullvad's server listing]]

* Initial Impressions

** Available Platforms

I am testing out Obscura on macOS, as that is the only available platform. This
is the biggest downside, as I would not want to support different VPNs on
different devices - if I'm using Obscura, I want to use it on all of my
platforms (macOS, iOS, and Ubuntu).

However, the macOS app is incredibly easy to install via the =.dmg= file
available on Obscura's website. Upon first launch, you're presented with a login
option and can create an account now, if you have not done so already.

** Payment

Once created, the app will ask you to pay if you do not have a subscription. As
far as I can tell, there is no free tier available. In my opinion, this is a
good thing as I hesitate to understand how privacy-focused apps make money when
they offer free services to users.

** Connection

Once you've enrolled in either a subscription or one-time payment, Obscura will
return you to the app and allow you to connect. You can choose a specific server
location or automatically connect.

** Speed

The connection feels naturally smooth and I haven't experienced any disruptions
or lag in my (very short) time testing out the application. To confirm, I
checked a speed test while connected to a server location in my country.

Speed test results:

- 85.49 Mbps (Down)
- 217.75 Mbps (Up)
- 25 ms (Ping)

** Mullvad Verification

Lastly, I checked with Mullvad's verification tool (=mullvad.net/en/check=) to
verify Obscura's claims that Obscura sends your traffic through Mullvad's exit
nodes before connecting to your target.

From the image below, we can see that Mullvad confirmed my traffic to be
connected through a Mullvad IP address.

* Final Thoughts

Overall, I have found the app to be fast and user friendly. The privacy features
are certainly compelling, but the platform has a ways to go before it can
displace something like Mullvad in the privacy-focused portion of the VPN
market.

I wish Obscura offered the following features:

- Available on more platforms
- Specifics on how many devices will be allowed per account
- More server locations, especially in countries with stronger data privacy laws
- Options to pay with other crypto beside Bitcoin, such as Monero
- Whitepapers or videos that walk through the technical details and show how
  traffic can be verified to be encrypted and connecting through the various
  expected nodes
- Verifiable builds

However, Obscura is a nice tool for now and I hope to see more information from
the technical side to help more users gain comfort around the security and
privacy of the tool.
