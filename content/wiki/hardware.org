Probably should have added more RAM but Macbooks are stupid expensive.

** Homelab

:CUSTOM_ID: homelab

I run a small homelab with a mix of consumer (compute/storage) and
enterprise (network) hardware. I try to keep the lab energy efficient
and quiet as my top priorities.

*** IoT
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: iot
:END:
A collection of mainly smart lights, sensors, and smart appliances. My
first preference is to disable all networking for new smart devices or
simply not connect internet in the first place (e.g. I never enable
internet on my smart TVs). If the smart device requires LAN access, I
will connect the device to my guest-restricted IoT network. As a last
resort, I will set-up the internet but monitor the DNS lookups via
NextDNS and forcibly block any domains I do not want the device to be
using. If the device is egregious or shady, I'll just sell it and either
replace it or live without it.

1. Rack-Mount Server

   I wasn't happy with using low-powered PCs as servers and I knew I did
   not want the ear-shattering enterprise rack-mounted servers, so I
   built my own.

   | CPU                | AMD Ryzen 7 5700G with Radeon Graphics |
   | RAM                | 64GB RAM (2x32GB)                      |
   | Storage (On-board) | Western Digital 500GB M.2 NVME SSD     |
   | Storage (HDD Bay)  | 48TB HDD                               |
   | PSU                | Corsair RM850 PSU                      |

2. Other

   These ran as my main servers before I built the rack-mounted server
   above. I have shut these down indefinitely for now as I have no use
   for them.

   - Dell OptiPlex
   - Raspberry Pi 4
