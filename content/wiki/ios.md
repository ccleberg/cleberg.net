### Privacy & Security

I generally follow the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) by only permitting the bare minimum privileges and revoking as soon as they are no longer required.

Here's the baseline I start with:

- Disable:
  - Analytics & Improvements
  - Apple Advertising
  - Apple ID > Sign-In & Security > Two-Factor Authentication
  - Location Services > System Services > Product Improvement
  - Tracking > Allow Apps to Request to Track
  - Safari > Advanced > Privacy Preserving Ad Measurement
- Enable:
  - Apple ID > iCloud > Advanced Data Protection
  - Apple ID > Personal Information > Communication Preferences
  - App Privacy Report
  - Location Services only for Camera, Find My, UDisc, & WiFiman
    (`While   Using`)
  - Safari > Prevent Cross-Site Tracking
