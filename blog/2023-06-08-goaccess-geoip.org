## Overview

[GoAccess](https://goaccess.io/) is an open source real-time web log analyzer 
and interactive viewer that runs in a terminal in *nix systems or through your 
browser.

## Installation

To start, you'll need to install GoAccess for your OS. Here's an example for 
Debian-based distros:

```bash
sudo apt install goaccess
```

Next, find any number of the MaxMind GeoIP database files on GitHub or another 
file hosting website. We're going to use P3TERX's version in this example:

```bash
wget https://github.com/P3TERX/GeoLite.mmdb/raw/download/GeoLite2-City.mmdb
```

Be sure to save this file in an easy to remember location!

## Usage

In order to utilize the full capabilities of GoAccess and MMDB, start with the 
command template below and customize as necessary. This will export an HTML 
view of the GoAccess dashboard, showing all relevant information related to 
that site's access log. You can also omit the `-o output.html` parameter if you 
prefer to view the data within the CLI instead of creating an HTML file.

With the addition of the GeoIP Database parameter, section `16 - Geo Location` 
will be added with the various countries that are associated with the collected 
IP addresses.

```bash
zcat /var/log/nginx/example.access.log.*.gz | goaccess     \
--geoip-database=/home/user/GeoLite2-City.mmdb             \
--date-format=%d/%b/%Y                                     \
--time-format=%H:%M:%S                                     \
--log-format=COMBINED                                      \
-o output.html                                             \
/var/log/nginx/example.access.log -
```

### Example Output

You can also see the GeoIP card created by the integration of the MaxMind 
database information.

That's all there is to it! 
Informational data is provided in an organized fashion with minimal effort.
