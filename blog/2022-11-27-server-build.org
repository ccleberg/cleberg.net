#+title: Building a Custom Rack-Mount Server
#+date:  2022-11-27

** The Dilemma
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-dilemma
:END:
For years, I have been using desktops and a Raspberry Pi as the backbone
of my homelab. I have always wanted to move toward a single dedicated
server that could handle all of my tasks, but was often put off by the
complexity of the choices (and financial roadblocks at some times).

However, after purchasing a small server rack this past year, I have
been researching to see what kind of rack-mounted server I could buy. I
initially bought a Dell R720XD loaded up with everything I could ever
want in a server - but I did not care for it. It was far too loud, and
the age of the CPU/RAM was something I wanted to improve upon.

After returning the R720XD, I decided that I wanted to build my own
server with modern, consumer-grade PC components. This time, I am very
happy with the results of my server.

** Components

I'll start by listing all the components I used for this server build:

- *Case*:
  [[https://www.rosewill.com/rosewill-rsv-r4100u-black/p/9SIA072GJ92825][Rosewill
  RSV-R4100U 4U Server Chassis Rackmount Case]]
- *Motherboard*: [[https://nzxt.com/product/n7-b550][NZXT B550]]
- *CPU*: AMD Ryzen 7 5700G with Radeon Graphics
- *GPU*: N/A - I specifically chose one of the few AMD CPUs that support
  onboard graphics.
- *RAM*: 64GB RAM (2x32GB) /Max of 128GB RAM on this motherboard/
- *Boot Drive*: Western Digital 500GB M.2 NVME SSD
- *HDD Bay*:
  - 10TB WD White /(shucked, moved from previous server)/
  - 8TB WD White /(shucked, moved from previous server)/
  - 2 x 8TB WD Red Plus /(Black Friday lined up perfectly with this
    build, so I grabbed two of these)/
- *PSU*: Corsair RM850 PSU
- *Extras*:
  - Corsair TM3Q Thermal Paste
  - Noctua 120mm fan /(replacement for front case fan)/
  - 2 x Noctua 80mm fans /(replacement for rear case fans)/
  - CableMatters 6Gbps SATA Cables

** Building the Server
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: building-the-server

This took quite a while for me to build (in my opinion of time),
totaling around 3 hours from start to finish. The case has some peculiar
construction, so you have to completely remove the ODD & HDD cages to
install the motherboard and other components first.

Now, I've never built a computer of any kind before, so I was quite
nervous. Personally, the only challenging part was getting the CPU
cooler to screw into the motherboard without sliding the thermal paste
around too much underneath. I'm still not entirely sure if I did a great
job of it, but nothing's broken yet.

The main components were all fine and simple. However, installing the
hard drives is slightly tedious as I need to power off the server and
completely unscrew the HDD cage to install or remove any drives.
Additionally, the drives are screwed directly into the metal cage with
small screws, which are quite a bit different from the HDD trays I'm
used to in other machines.

Seeing that the cases with hot-swap bays were 3-4x the price, I'm okay
dealing with the tedium of removing the cage to install new drives.

** Software
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: software
:END:
I'm not going to dive into the software as I have done so in other
recent posts. However, I wanted to note that I am using Alpine Linux on
this server and hosting most services inside Docker. No virtual machines
(VMs) and very few bare-metal services.

** The Results
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: the-results
:END:
How did my build turn out? Well, after migrating my other servers and
their services over, I found that my server is blazing fast. The
heaviest of my applications, Plex, is handled with ease. Even 4k
streaming seems to be effortless.

I am very happy with the results and will likely continue to improve on
this server as the years go by rather than buying another used server
online.

*** Mistakes I Made
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: mistakes-i-made
:END:
This post wouldn't be complete unless I wrote about the mistakes I made
while building. The only real mistake I made beyond a "whoops I dropped
a screw" related to airflow and fan direction.

While installing the two new hard drives that showed up on 2022-11-30
and getting ready to install the case in my rack, I noticed that the
hard drive temperatures were quite high.

I used the =smartctl= command for each of my drives (=/dev/sda= through
=/dev/sdd=):

#+begin_src sh
doas smartctl -a /dev/sda | grep Temperature_Celsius
#+end_src

The results were unusual - all four drives were idling at ~44-46 degrees
Celsius. The only drive that was cooler was my 10TB drive, which was at
38 degrees Celsius. I noted that this 10TB drive was also closest to the
case fan.

#+begin_src sh
ID# ATTRIBUTE_NAME          FLAG     VALUE WORST THRESH TYPE      UPDATED  WHEN_FAILED RAW_VALUE
# /dev/sda
194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0002   147   147   000    Old_age   Always       -       44 (Min/Max 22/46)
# /dev/sdb
194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0002   141   141   000    Old_age   Always       -       46 (Min/Max 21/48)
# /dev/sdc
194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0002   144   144   000    Old_age   Always       -       45 (Min/Max 19/61)
# /dev/sdd
194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0002   171   171   000    Old_age   Always       -       38 (Min/Max 14/56)
#+end_src

After looking to see if I could fit more fans into the case, I noticed
that the 120mm fan used for intake from the front of the case was
actually pushing air out of the case by mistake. This fan sits right in
front of the hard drive bay.

Once I flipped the fan around to act as an intake fan, the temperatures
dropped immediately! They are now idling at ~31-33 degrees Celsius. A
single fan spinning the wrong way caused my drives to idle 10-15 degrees
higher than they should have.

#+begin_src sh
ID# ATTRIBUTE_NAME          FLAG     VALUE WORST THRESH TYPE      UPDATED  WHEN_FAILED RAW_VALUE
# /dev/sda
194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0002   209   209   000    Old_age   Always       -       31 (Min/Max 14/56)
# /dev/sdb
194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0002   196   196   000    Old_age   Always       -       33 (Min/Max 19/61)
# /dev/sdc
194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0002   203   203   000    Old_age   Always       -       32 (Min/Max 21/48)
# /dev/sdd
194 Temperature_Celsius     0x0002   196   196   000    Old_age   Always       -       33 (Min/Max 22/46)
#+end_src

This was a silly error to make, but I'm glad I found it today before I
screwed the case into the rack and made things a lot more tedious to
fix.
